# System Architecture

## Overview

MyOS is a modern, modular operating system with a microkernel architecture. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system's core components and their interactions.

## Core Components

### 1. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

The HAL provides a uniform interface to hardware, abstracting low-level details:

#### CPU Management
- CPU initialization and configuration
- Interrupt management
- Power state control
- CPU information retrieval

#### Memory Management
- Physical memory management
- Page allocation/deallocation
- Memory statistics
- DMA operations

#### Device Management
- Device registration and enumeration
- Driver management
- I/O operations
- Interrupt routing

### 2. Memory Management

#### Physical Memory Manager
- Page frame allocation
- Memory mapping
- Physical memory tracking
- Memory statistics

#### Virtual Memory Manager
- Page directory management
- Page table manipulation
- Memory protection
- Address space management

#### Memory Layout
```
0x00000000 - 0x00100000: Reserved (BIOS, etc.)
0x00100000 - 0x00101000: Page Bitmap
0x00101000 - 0x00400000: Kernel
0xC0000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF: User Space
```

### 3. Process Management

#### Process Structure
- Process ID and state management
- Memory space management
- CPU context handling
- Priority scheduling

#### Scheduler
- Priority-based scheduling
- Anti-starvation mechanisms
- Process switching
- Time slice management

#### Process States
1. READY
2. RUNNING
3. BLOCKED
4. ZOMBIE

### 4. Device Driver Framework

#### Driver Model
- Unified driver interface
- Driver registration system
- Device discovery
- Resource management

#### Supported Driver Types
1. Block devices
2. Character devices
3. Network devices
4. Display devices
5. Input devices
6. Sound devices

### 5. File System

#### Virtual File System (VFS)
- File abstraction
- Directory management
- File operations
- Mount point handling

#### File Operations
- Open/Close
- Read/Write
- Seek
- Directory listing

### 6. Network Stack

#### Protocol Support
- Ethernet
- IPv4
- TCP/UDP
- ARP

#### Network Components
- Interface management
- Socket handling
- Protocol handlers
- Packet processing

### 7. Command System

#### Command Handler
- Command registration
- Argument parsing
- Command execution
- Error handling

#### Shell Interface
- Command line processing
- History management
- Tab completion
- Window management

## System Initialization

The system initialization follows this sequence:

1. Boot Sequence
   ```
   BIOS → Bootloader → Kernel Entry
   ```

2. Kernel Initialization
   ```
   HAL Init → Memory Init → Process Init → Driver Init
   ```

3. System Services
   ```
   File System → Network Stack → Command System
   ```

## Inter-Component Communication

### 1. Synchronous Communication
- System calls
- Direct function calls
- Command execution

### 2. Asynchronous Communication
- Interrupts
- Event handlers
- Message queues

### 3. Data Flow
```
User Space → System Call → Kernel → Device Drivers → Hardware
```

## Memory Protection

### 1. Ring Levels
- Ring 0: Kernel Mode
- Ring 3: User Mode

### 2. Page Protection
- Present/Not Present
- Read/Write
- User/Supervisor
- Execute/No-Execute

## Error Handling

### 1. Error Categories
- Hardware Errors
- Memory Errors
- Process Errors
- File System Errors
- Network Errors

### 2. Error Recovery
- Error detection
- Error reporting
- Recovery procedures
- System stability

## Performance Considerations

### 1. CPU Usage
- Process scheduling optimization
- Interrupt handling efficiency
- System call overhead

### 2. Memory Usage
- Page allocation strategies
- Cache utilization
- Memory fragmentation

### 3. I/O Performance
- Buffer management
- DMA utilization
- Device polling vs interrupts

## Security Features

### 1. Process Isolation
- Memory protection
- Process privileges
- Resource access control

### 2. System Protection
- Interrupt protection
- I/O protection
- Memory protection

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Short Term
